## Implementations
* Q1:
  * Two applications, disjoint and joint class implementing tumbling window and sliding window
  * Output will be stored in current dir (script dir, copied from HDFS:/), named C_Q1_disjoint.output or C_Q1_joint.output
    * NOTE: before run single script, it will delete all old outputs
    * All output will also be printed to screen
* Q2:
  * One application with parameter for allowed lateness:
    * late [lateness: 100]    (will allow 100 seconds lateness)
    * Output will be stored in current dir (script dir, copied from HDFS:/), named C_Q2_[lateness].output
  * tools: compare.sh
    * to compare the output of Q2 with Q1_disjoint
    * ./compare.sh source_file1 source_file2 output_file
      * eg. ./compare.sh ./C_Q1_disjoint.output ./C_Q2_100.output ./common_100
        * it will compare disjoint with 100 lateness to Q1 then write common windows to file named common_100

## Files
* PartCQuestion-1-disjoint.java

  * common windows we get
  * output files of every question, every cases
